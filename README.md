# Programming contests
My solutions to some problems for programming contests/online judges.

The most part is from my early years 2007-2012.

I include solutions to problems from OJ since I disagree with the outdated model. I strongly believe in the 
democratization of programming contests: knowledge should be available to everyone.

I you are problem author and would like me to remove a solution to your problem (e.g. used in interviews) please contact me.
